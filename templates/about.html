    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        The idea for spygit was actually used for the
        <a href="http://djangodash.com">Django Dash</a> competition I competed
        in several years ago.  This was my first competition, but I've since
        competed each of the last two years.

        Make sure to checkout the original
        <a href=" http://spygit.durden.webfactional.com/">spygit</a> site.  I
        did not move all the code from the original 
        <a href=" http://spygit.durden.webfactional.com/">spygit</a> here
        because it was a <a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a> 1.1
        application.  I did not feel it was necessary to reproduce all the
        content, etc. here.

    <p>
        The original idea for spygit was partially inspired by the
        <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">HTML validator</a>.
